# $CTH (Crypto True Heroes)
Crypto True Heros is an ERC-20 token, an Ethereum based smart contract, limited to $CTH xxx, xxx, xxx (values under study) focused 100% on safe and guaranteed donations. The main idea of the project is open the opportunities of donate using the mechanism of the free internet on blockchain.

The main $CTH rule is that only blockchain network verified wallets (possibility current world organizations under study) can exchange $CTH to real world commodities, ensuring that all donated money will have a real destiny, like health, hunger, education and other social activities to make the world better.

You can transfer $CTH for anyone you want, anytime you want, or to buy any digital stuff. But in real world, all values from $CTH will be used to benefy needy people.

In current world benefy organizations, there's always a chalenge to keep the biggest % of the donations to the end point, so the middleware stuff is a challenge, like logistics, other companies envolving and losts linked with not optimized procces. (And there's always a risk of corruption when is money envolved).

## The "CTH" initials 
$CTH means "Crypto True Heroes". The name can be explained at the expression "Real Heroes don't wear capes". In a free internet this rule is the same. That's why $CTH based idea is important: No matter who you are, the only thing that metters is how much people you can help.
