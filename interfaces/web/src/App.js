              <p>First of all reading: We need you to make this project a real thing! We are looking for intusiasts, no matter what are your expertise, for contribution. Any idea is welcome. Any critics or questioning is welcome twice.</p>
              <h1>$CTH (Crypto True Heroes)</h1>
              <p>Crypto True Heros is an ERC-20 token, an Ethereum based smart contract, limited to $CTH xxx, xxx, xxx (values under study) focused 100% on safe and guaranteed donations. The main idea of the project is open the opportunities of donate using the mechanism of the free internet on blockchain.</p>
              <p>The main $CTH rule is that only blockchain network verified wallets (possibility current world organizations under study) can exchange $CTH to real world commodities, ensuring that all donated money will have a real destiny, like health, hunger, education and other social activities to make the world better.</p>
              <p>You can transfer $CTH for anyone you want, anytime you want, or to buy any digital stuff. But in real world, all values from $CTH will be used to benefy needy people.</p>
              <p>In current world benefy organizations, there's always a chalenge to keep the biggest % of the donations to the end point, so the middleware stuff is a challenge, like logistics, other companies envolving and losts linked with not optimized procces. (And there's always a risk of corruption when is money envolved).</p>

              <h2>The "CTH" initials</h2>
              <p>$CTH means "Crypto True Heroes". The name can be explained at the expression "Real Heroes don't wear capes". In a free internet this rule is the same. That's why $CTH based idea is important: No matter who you are, the only thing that metters is how much people you can help.</p>
